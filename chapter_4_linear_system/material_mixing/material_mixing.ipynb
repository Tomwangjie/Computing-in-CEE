    "Concrete mixture is made of cement, sand, and gravel (before water is added). A common problem is mix different concrete mixture to achieve certian cement, sand and gravel ratio. For example, a contractor wants 100 cubic feet of mixture with cement:sand:gravel = 1:2:3. The contractor has three suppliers who can supply mixtures as follows:\n",
    "   - Supplier 1: cement:sand:gravel = 1:3:4\n",

    "The question is how much the contractor needs to buy from each supplier to achieve his goal? To solve this problem, let's define $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$ as the volume to buy from each supplier. Then, the total volume should satisfy\n",
