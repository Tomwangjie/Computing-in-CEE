    "In engineering and science, the Buckingham $\\pi$ theroem is an important tool for dimensional analysis. The theorem says that if an equation for a physcial process or phenomenom involves $n$ physical variables and $k$ physical dimensions, then the equation can be made dimensionless with $p=n-k$ dimensionless variables $\\pi_1$, $\\pi_2$, ... $\\pi_p$. Therefore, the Buckingham $\\pi$ theroem is often used in dimensional analysis. By formulating or describing a physical process in dimensionless varibles, we reduce the number of variables, better understand the physics, ease the analysis of data, and help desgin model testing based on similitudes. \n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the dimensionless variables $\\pi_1$, $\\pi_2$, ... $\\pi_p$, there are several methods. One method is simply by inspection, which usually requires some experience. Another method is the exponenent method, which is also called the method of repeating variables. In this example, we show the use of the linear equation system in the exponent method to find the dimensionless variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "The example here is from elemenary fluid mechanics. Often, we need to find the pressure drop per unit length $\\Delta P_l$ along a long, smooth-walled horizontal, circular pipe. There are several steps in the exponent method. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 1: list all \"independent\" variables for the problem\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\Delta P_l = f(D, \\rho, \\mu, V)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $D$ is the pipe diameter, $\\rho$ is fluid density, $\\mu$ is fluid dynamic viscosity, and $V$ is average fluid velocity in the pipe. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 2: express all variables in terms of their basic dimensions (force - $F$, length - $L$, and time - $T$)\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "[\\Delta P_l] &=& FL^{-3} \\\\\n",

    "[\\mu]  &=& FL^{-2}T \\\\\n",
    "[V] &=& LT^{-1}\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 3: determine the number of PI terms. We have three basic dimensions in this problem (force, length, and time). So $k$ = 3. And there are five variables. So $n$ = 5. According to the Buckingham PI theorem, the number of dimensionless PI terms should be $p=n-k=5-3=2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 4: select \"repeating\" variables from the list of possibilities. The repeating variables will be used to form each PI term and they must be dimensionly independent. The number of repeating varialbes must be the same as the number of dimensions, which is three in this example. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we select $V$, $D$, and $\\rho$ as the repeating variables. \n",
