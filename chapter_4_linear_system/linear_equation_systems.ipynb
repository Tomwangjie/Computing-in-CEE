    "Direct solution methods solve the linear equation system directly, instead of iteratively. They produce the solution with finite number of operations. For large linear equation system, the required number of operations is also large and thus direct solution methods are computationally costly for large systems. For this reason, in reality, direct solution methods are often used for small to medium size systems. New computing techniques, such as parallel computing and GPU computing may greatly improve the computational efficiency of direct methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, if there is no rounding error, the solution from direct methods should be exact. A more attractive feature of direct methods is that the solution is guaranteed if the system is not singular. In contrast, most of iterative methods can not guarantee the same. So for some mission critical systems where a guarantee of solution is a must, direct solution methods are the only choices. \n",

    "the linear system \n",

    "So, without normalization, the determinant does not mean too much for comparison. In the context of this chapter, scaling may help when the magnitudes of coefficient are very different between different equations in a linear system.  Scaling can be combined with partial pivoting to determine when pivoting is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "A related topic is ill-conditioned systems. An ill-condition system is not singular, but it is close to singular. Theoretically, they do have a unique solution. However, the solution is sensitive to small perturbations to the matrix coefficients. Numerically, it is due to round-off errors, which may be alleviated with double (or higher) precision.  Scaling may also help. \n",

    "The following code is to test the effect of single, double, and half precision on the results of a system with scaling inbalance. The solution should be **x** = [1.0,1.0]. But depending on what precision is used, the numerical solution may be wrong or the algorithm does not even work. To see the difference, in the line starting with \"data_type\", change the \"data_type\" to float16 (half), loat32 (single), or, float64 (double). You will see that for the same system, when half precision is used, the Gaussian elimination algorithm fails; when single precision is used, it gives wrong solution; only when double precision is used, it gives the correct solution."
